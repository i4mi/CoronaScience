The Corona Science application is written in React Native. This brings [**React**'s][r] declarative UI framework to iOS and Android. With React Native, you use native UI controls and have full access to the native platform.

- **Declarative.** React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug.
- **Component-Based.** Build encapsulated components that manage their state, then compose them to make complex UIs.
- **Developer Velocity.** See local changes in seconds. Changes to JavaScript code can be live reloaded without rebuilding the native app.
- **Portability.** Reuse code across iOS, Android, and [other platforms][p].

React Native is developed and supported by many companies and individual core contributors. Find out more in our [ecosystem overview][e].

## ðŸ“‹ Requirements

React Native apps may target iOS 10.0 and Android 4.1 (API 16) or newer. You may use Windows, macOS, or Linux as your development operating system, though building and running iOS apps is limited to macOS. Tools like [Expo](https://expo.io) can be used to work around this.

## ðŸŽ‰ Building your first React Native app

Follow the [Getting Started guide](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html). The recommended way to install React Native depends on your project. Here you can find short guides for the most common scenarios:

- [Trying out React Native][hello-world]
- [Creating a New Application][new-app]
- [Adding React Native to an Existing Application][existing]

[hello-world]: https://snack.expo.io/@hramos/hello,-world!
[new-app]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started.html
[existing]: https://reactnative.dev/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html

## ðŸ“– Documentation

The full documentation for React Native can be found on this [website][gs-docs].

The React Native documentation discusses components, APIs, and topics that are specific to React Native. For further documentation on the React API that is shared between React Native and React DOM, refer to the [React documentation][r-docs].

The source for the React Native documentation and website is hosted on a separate repo, [**@facebook/react-native-website**][repo-website].

## ðŸ©º MIDATA

[**MIDATA**][midata] shows how data can be used for the common good, while at the same time ensuring the citizensâ€™ control over their personal data.

The MIDATA model is designed for international application: MIDATA Switzerland supports the foundation of regional or national MIDATA cooperatives that share the data platform infrastructure.
Owners of a data account at MIDATA may actively contribute to medical research and clinical studies by granting selective access to their personal data. They may become members of the cooperative and thereby control the cooperative.

The full documentation for MIDATA Developers can be found on [this website][midata-api].
